			<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Ismail and I am an ecologist who is doing a PhD in Forest Ecology Group at ETH Zurich. My main interests are fire ecology and climate change but I am also interested in statistics and r programming.</p>

<p>In 2013, I graduated from Hacettepe University where I was studying biology and then in 2016, I finished my master thesis at Fire Ecology and Seed Research Lab. After that, I got the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship for my PhD and moved to Zurich, Switzerland in September 2016.</p>

<p>I have been doing <strong>Aikido</strong> for more than four years. For a half year, I also tried <strong>Judo</strong> but then stopped. I am planning to start Judo again at some point in my life.</p>

<p>I love <strong>hiking</strong> and <strong>photography</strong>. While I am hiking I always have my camera with me. I am especially interested in macro and landscape photography.</p>

<p>I <strong>read</strong> a lot. It&rsquo;s mostly science, Sci-Fi, and fantasy books but sometimes I like to read classics as well.</p>

<p>I am actively having a role in <strong>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Society of Turkey</strong>. Our aim is to improve the quality of scientific research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology in Turkey, gather researchers under same roof and support young researchers.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>science communication</strong> project in Turkish named &ldquo;Bilimsel Olsun&rdquo;. For more information visit the <a href="http://bilimselolsun.tumblr.com"><em>related page</em></a>.</p>
