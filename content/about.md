Hello!

My name is Ismail and I am an ecologist who is doing a PhD in Forest Ecology Group at ETH Zurich. My main interests are fire ecology and climate change but I am also interested in statistics and r programming.

In 2013, I graduated from Hacettepe University where I was studying biology and then in 2016, I finished my master thesis at Fire Ecology and Seed Research Lab. After that, I got the Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship for my PhD and moved to Zurich, Switzerland in September 2016.

I have been doing **Aikido** for more than four years. For a half year, I also tried **Judo** but then stopped. I am planning to start Judo again at some point in my life.

I love **hiking** and **photography**. While I am hiking I always have my camera with me. I am especially interested in macro and landscape photography.

I **read** a lot. It's mostly science, Sci-Fi, and fantasy books but sometimes I like to read classics as well.

I am actively having a role in **Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Society of Turkey**. Our aim is to improve the quality of scientific research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology in Turkey, gather researchers under same roof and support young researchers.

I have a **science communication** project in Turkish named "Bilimsel Olsun". For more information visit the [*related page*](http://bilimselolsun.tumblr.com).
